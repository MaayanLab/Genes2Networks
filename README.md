# Genes2Networks
Tool for Creating Subnetworks from Lists of Mammalian Genes or Proteins
A software tool that can be used to place lists of mammalian genes in the context of background mammalian signalome and interactome networks. The input to the program is a list of human Entrez Gene gene symbols and background networks in SIG format, while the output includes: (a) all identified interactions for the genes/proteins, (b) a subnetwork connecting the genes/proteins using intermediate components that are used to connect the genes, (c) ranking of the specificity of intermediate components to interact with the list of genes/proteins.
